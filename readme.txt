QuickCustomize is a plugin that adds a "Quick Customize" button to the top of all WordPress administration screens.

When you click the button, you can choose to edit menus, widgets, and more.

When you use QuickCustomize, you never leave the page that you're on. No matter what you do, you always stay on the same page.
